The proposed research does not entail any significant ethical considerations. The focus of the study is solely on the material analysis of used replacement heart valves and these valves are obtained anonymously, without any personal or sensitive data linked to the former owners of these implants. Only medical information related to these implants are the following: the brand and model of the implant, and the time spent in the patient's body. Nonetheless, adherence to scientific integrity will always be a priority throughout the research.
