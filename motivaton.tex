My suggested research on "Surface Analysis of Used Mechanical Heart Valves for Microcracks and Defects Detection" seeks to observe the changes in surface quality over the years in valves that were removed. My motivation and intrigue regarding the extent of surface defects on used heart valves and the probable link between service life and valve depreciation stem from studying mechanical engineering for my bachelor's, studying materials engineering for my master's, and also from having a cardiologist father. This study integrates materials engineering and medical ideas and gives insight into the relationship between service duration and surface defects in removed mechanical heart valves. It is expected that the surface quality clearly worsens over the duration of usage. In the later stages of the research, perhaps at the Masterâ€™s Thesis stage, an attempt to categorize and/or quantify the surface defects with a machine learning algorithm could be made.
