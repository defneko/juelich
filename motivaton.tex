Motivated by patient safety and medical innovation, my proposed research on "Surface Analysis of Used Mechanical Heart Valves for Microcracks and Defects Detection" aims to uncover wear mechanisms that compromise valve performance. Rooted in my father's cardiologist expertise, I'm intrigued by the extent of microcracks on used heart valves and the potential link between service life and valve depreciation. This interdisciplinary study merges materials engineering and medical insights, exemplifying collaboration's potency in solving real-world challenges. With practical implications in heart valve design and testing, this research echoes my commitment to advancing medical science through interdisciplinary excellence.
