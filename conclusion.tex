This research proposal outlines the plan to study the surface of used mechanical heart valves for defects. Following a timeline, it is aimed to achieve the goals through research, sample collection, and analysis in a systematic manner.

It is aimed to provide insights into heart valve performance, contributing to a better understanding of the incidence of surface defects on mechanical heart valves. This will help with understanding the most defect-prone regions of the heart valves and ultimately suggest possible improvements.
