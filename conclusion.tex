This research proposal outlines the plan to study the correlation between the service duration and the surface quality of used mechanical heart valves. Following a timeline, it is aimed to achieve the goals through research, sample collection, and analysis in a systematic manner. It is aimed to provide insights into heart valve performance, contributing to a better understanding of the incidence of surface defects on mechanical heart valves. This will help with understanding the most defect-prone regions of the heart valves and ultimately develop more advanced methods or tools to quantify/characterize the surface defect on removed heart valves.
